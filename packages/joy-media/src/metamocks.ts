    description: 'Whats your favorite McDonald\'s™ item? For me, it\'s the McChicken®. The best fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McChicken® sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige. One time I asked for McChicken® sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, \"Wow, three for free!\" and the nice friendly McDonald\'s™ worker laughed and said, \"I\'m going to call you 3-for-free!\". Now the staff greets me with \"hey it\'s 3-for-free!\" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It\'s such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald\'s™ restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I\'m in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs. I even dip my fries in McChicken® sauce, it\'s delicious! What a great restaurant.'
